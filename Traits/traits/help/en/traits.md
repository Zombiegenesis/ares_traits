# Traits
This command lets you record your character's traits.  Traits represent anything that stands out about your character, anything out of the ordinary. Powers, skills, talents, advantages, flaws, and weaknesses all count as traits.

`traits` - Show you own traits.
`traits/set <traits>` - Sets your traits.

Traits should be formatted so that each part is clear and distinct from the rest. There are a number of ways for this to be achieved. We ask that you please review other, approved, character's traits to get an idea for some of the ways this can be done.
